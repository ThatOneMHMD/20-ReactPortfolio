## Description

This React front-end App functions as a professional Portfolio for Muhammad Atrach (myself). Once the portfolio is running (clicking on the Live URL above), the default page "About" will run, showing me some information about myself. Once other titles in the navBar are clicked, the corresponding sections will load without the page reloading. In this portfolio, potential employers can read my information, contact me, see my previous projects, and download a full copy of my resume!

## Screenshots

Note that the footer is only shown once in these screenshots, as the page is longer than my screenshot capacity (it had to take two screenshots)!
